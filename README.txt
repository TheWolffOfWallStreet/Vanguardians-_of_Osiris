Vanguardians of Osiris is a project website that I chose to create for my web development course 
through the Code Kentucky program. I chose to make my project about a game that I am very passionate 
about, called Destiny 2. The Vanguardians of Osiris website was built with a similar function as a 
Destiny 2 boosting website, which charges individuals money to help them with in game content. I have 
always frowned upon this and decided to create a website that offers to help and teach the same content 
without charging fellow guardians for wanting to enjoy all that this wonderful game has to offer. 

There are links that allow users to browse a variety of options that we offer, and a form that they can fill out 
and submit on a "contact us" page that allows them to input their email and "gamertag" so that we can contact 
them, and select as many options as they see fit before submitting it. We will then contact them as we can and 
help them complete their requests in a timely manner so that they can continue enjoying all that the game has to 
offer. 

It is important to note that we do not ask for payment for these services, and will only include a 
zero-obligation option for donations if our happy and satisfied users would like to contribute. 

The features from the CSS and JavaScript list I chose to integrate into my project are:

CSS and JavaScript- A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes with the 
use of a "hamburger" button. 

CSS- I used CSS grid to help organize and display available content on my crucible, PVE, and weapon arsenal pages 
for both mobile and desktop view.

CSS and JavaScript- I used both CSS and JavaScript to add individual show/hide descriptions for each available 
option on my crucible, PVE, and weapon arsenal pages. (uses separate CSS and JavaScript code from nav bar)
